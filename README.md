A collection of details and scripts to run [amaru](https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru) and Raspberry Pis.

# Build

## On RPI

Building directly on the real machine is always an option but might require [tweaks](#tweaks) and time!

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pragma-org/amaru
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sudo apt install -y libclang-dev 
cargo build --release # 1 hour on RPI5
```

## Cross building

Cross building allow to pre-create binaries for RPI on different (more powerful) machine with different architecture.
Note that cross-building is probably better on a linux environment.

### PIOS 64 bits

```shell
cross build --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl --release
```

# Running

Regular `amaru` commands can be used to run on an RPI. Note that it's probably a good idea to start with a fresh amaru db. Running `bootstrap` (to start from a `cardano-node` snapshot) will either be pretty slow or crash (on Pi zero).

## Tweaks

Some RPIs require specific configuration to be able to run `amaru`.

### Pi ZERO

Pi zero do not have any swap by default. Couple with the lower amount of ram (512MB) it won't run `amaru` OOB.


dtparam=spi=on

```shell
# Increase swap

sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
sudo vi /etc/dphys-swapfile
# edit `CONF_SWAPSIZE=100` to `CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024`
sudo dphys-swapfile setup
sudo dphys-swapfile swapon
```

#### With inky eInk screen

Make sure [inky](https://github.com/pimoroni/inky) has been properly setup.
Then in your `amaru-rpi` folder, run: `PEER_ADDRESS=192.168.1.61:3001 PATH=$PATH:. ./scripts/badge-per-epoch.sh`


## Install systemd service

sudo systemctl status amaru.service
journalctl -u amaru.service --no-pager
