//! A Ratatui example that shows the full range of RGB colors that can be displayed in the terminal.
//!
//! Requires a terminal that supports 24-bit color (true color) and unicode.
//!
//! This example also demonstrates how implementing the Widget trait on a mutable reference
//! allows the widget to update its state while it is being rendered. This allows the fps
//! widget to update the fps calculation and the colors widget to update a cached version of
//! the colors to render instead of recalculating them every frame.
//!
//! This is an alternative to using the `StatefulWidget` trait and a separate state struct. It
//! is useful when the state is only used by the widget and doesn't need to be shared with
//! other widgets.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently reading.
//! See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui release.
//!
